	<br>
	<p>The original edition was announced on October 25th, 2011; the game's first trailer was released on November 2nd, 2011, 
	at 4:00 PM GMT. The game was initially slated for a Spring 2013 release and there were even posters printed saying this 
	but was delayed until September 17th the same year. Then, on July 15th, 2013, Rockstar announced the Japanese 
	release 
	date for the game: October 10th, 2013, almost a month after it was released in the Western world. The enhanced 
	edition was announced on June 9th, 2014, with pre-orders made available on June 10.

	<font face="calibri"><font color="#F2F2F2"><p>Grand Theft Auto V evolves nearly every mechanic that was in the previous 
	Grand Theft Auto games. As far as driving 
	goes, the vehicles have been greatly improved, with Rockstar running more complex physics on them, such as making some 
	cars hold to the ground slightly better. The driving mechanics feel more like a racing game, particularly the Midnight 
	Club series, compared to Grand Theft Auto IV's rocky, boat-like handling system. The shooting mechanics are better in 
	terms of the feel of the mechanics and larger compared to the melee mechanics in the game, that being said, melee has 
	been improved over the previous titles as well. Weapon selection has now also been changed. Instead of the old way of 
	selecting through all the weapons sequentially, there is now a Weapon Wheel, which is similar to the one featured in Red 
	Dead Redemption, another game made by Rockstar Games. Grand Theft Auto V draws inspirations from many different Rockstar 
	titles in the past, including 
	<a href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Max_Payne"><font face="calibri"><font color="#cc9900">Max Payne 3</a></font>
	, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight_Club"><font face="calibri"><font color="#cc9900">Midnight Club</a></font>
	, <a href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Manhunt"><font face="calibri"><font color="#cc9900">Manhunt</a></font>
	, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Dead_Redemption"><font face="calibri"><font color="#cc9900">Red Dead Redemption</a>.</p></font>
	<p>There are many unique features in the game; one being that when the players are playing as one of three protagonists 
	in the game, the other two are living their independent daily lives, and the player may be surprised by what they find the
	characters doing when they switch back into them. Another unique feature is that the 
	<a href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Character_Wheel"><font face="calibri"><font color="#cc9900">character swapping feature</a></font>
	is executed in a Google Earth-styled manner and was displayed during a Game Informer demo, which was shown to have run 
	smoothly and without lag. The PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions present an exclusive feature, the
	<a href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/First-Person_View"><font face="calibri"><font color="#cc9900">first-person mode</a></font>
	, where the whole game can be played through the eyes of the protagonist. This gameplay mode presents a whole new way 
	to play thegame. Cars have detailed 
	<a href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle_Features#Working_Dashboards"><font face="calibri"><font color="#cc9900">interiors</a></font>
	different from one another; shooting is like that of a dedicated FPS game.</p>
	<p>New activities have been added, such as yoga, triathlons, jet skiing, parachuting, tennis, golf, and scuba diving.
	<a href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Random_Events"><font face="calibri"><font color="#cc9900">Random events</a></FONT>
	have also been added to the game and can appear anytime as the player explores around the map. The 
	<a href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Mobile_Phone"><font face="calibri"><font color="#cc9900">mobile phone</a></font>
	has returned from Grand Theft Auto IV but is now only used for calling the player's contacts, surfing the web, and 
	quick saving. Giving people the middle finger is another new feature the player can use while in a vehicle. Rockstar 
	recommended that the player do this in various locations around Los Santos to see the outcome; depending on where the 
	player is at, they will get varied reactions from pedestrians.</p>
	<p>Rockstar has also made changes to the pedestrian mechanics; some pedestrians can be seen at the bus stops in 
	<a href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/East_Los_Santos_(HD_Universe)"><font face="calibri"><font color="#cc9900">East Los Santos</a></font>
	, and the same people can reappear in 
	<a href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Rockford_Hills"><font face="calibri"><font color="#cc9900">Rockford Hills</a></font>
	working in the gardens of the opulent mansions. Some minor 
	mechanics that help convey the environment and appearance of Los Santos occur at certain times of day, such as a sprinkler
	system being turned on in the morning in wealthy areas like 
	<a href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Morningwood"><font face="calibri"><font color="#cc9900">Morningwood</a>.</p></font>
	<p>The map is larger than Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, Grand Theft Auto IV, and Red Dead Redemption combined. After some
	calculations by members of 
	<a href="http://gawdalmighty.com/"><font face="calibri"><font color="#cc9900">GawdAlmighty.com</a></font>
	, it is around 27.5 square miles (71.2 km2) in area when land and sea are combined.</p></font></font>

	<br>
	<font face="calibri"><font color="#F2F2F2"><p>Grand Theft Auto V has more vehicles than in any other Grand Theft Auto game to date, with a variety of vehicles, 
	including aeroplanes, helicopters, cars, utility vehicles, emergency service vehicles, motorcycles, and jet skis. Players 
	are able to fly planes, which was a cut feature from Grand Theft Auto IV because of the limited size of the map, but the 
	feature is now available in Grand Theft Auto V because of the much larger, open world map. There are also 
	<a href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Submersible"><font face="calibri"><font color="#b38600">

	Rhino</a></font>
	from previous GTA titles has returned, 
	including a new complex aiming system and a realistic depiction of a tank. A new feature also allows the player to 
	roll-over a vehicle when the car is flipped upside down.</p>
	
	<p>Like all previous games, a wide array of vehicles spawn driving around the map that can be stolen. To give the game a 
	sense of realism and make the map feel more alive, various vehicles (as well as pedestrians) spawn in 
	<a href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicles_in_GTA_V/Scenarios"><font face="calibri"><font color="#b38600">
	scenarios</a></font>
	to make them more interactive with the map, such as delivery vans pulling out of alleyways, emergency vehicles responding,
	or vehicles pulling in and out of driveways. This behaviour was present in GTA IV to a lesser extent and is revamped in 
	GTA V, even more so with the enhanced release of the game, where modified vehicles can spawn driving around, as well as 
	the presence of the fully-controllable

	lot less rosy than he hoped it would be; and Trevor, a violent maniac driven by the chance of a cheap high and the next

	<font face="calibri"><font color="#F2F2F2"><p><em>"For those stuck in traffic, tune in to the Los Santos radio dial for a wide range of music styles to choose from.
	From the sound of the street on Radio Los Santos, Non Stop Pop FM's infectious tunes, FlyLo FMs cutting-edge dance music
	or the funk of Space 103.2, you won't want to sit still, even if you have been in traffic for hours." - GTA V Website</p></eM></em>
	<p>As in previous Grand Theft Auto games, radio stations play a big part in Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online.</p>
	<p>Like the weapon system, switching between radio stations is now done by bringing up a radio station wheel to jump 
	to any station, or turn off the radio. In the PS4 version, the player can utilise the Touch Pad to change stations by 
	swiping up or down.</p>
	<p>Radio interference is heard when listening to a specific station and trying to leave the zone where that signal is 
	available. Blaine County Radio can only be selected in Blaine County and WCTR in Los Santos County. If the player leaves 
	the county while listening to the respective station they will lose the signal and the radio will automatically switch 
	to the next station on the radio wheel.</P></font>

	<a id="enhanced"><font color="#cc9900"><h1>Enhanced and PC Editions</h1></font></a>
	<br>	
	<font face="calibri"><font color="#F2F2F2"><p>Prior to the announcement of the eighth generation consoles and PC versions, there was wide speculation and 
	anticipation regarding an official announcement from Rockstar. On change.org, there was a petition with 728,000+ 
	signatures asking for a PC version at the time of the announcement. Within the comments section of the Rockstar Newswire,
	and many other GTA related blogs, there were many comments asking for a PC/Next Gen release. After its reveal at E3 
	2014, the news spread like wildfire and became one of the most talked-about announcements.</p>
	<p>The enhanced version of Grand Theft Auto V was released on November 18, 2014, for the PS4 and Xbox One and was released
	for PC on April 14, 2015. With the release, there are many improvements and changes compared to the versions released on 
	PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. No major graphical changes from PS4 and Xbox One are seen in the PC version, other than 
	further Draw Distance and 4K capable quality. The PC version also features 2 exclusive radio stations: The Lab 
	(now available for all consoles from the Ill-Gotten Gains Part 2 update) and Self Radio.</p>
	<p>The biggest new feature was a first-person view, which is not only available in vehicles but is also for the first 
	time available on foot. Several other features were added including increased reflections on bodywork, detailed interiors 
	of vehicles and buildings, new weather effects, longer draw distance, higher resolution textures, 4k capability and 
	many more.</p></font>

	<a id="controversy"><font color="#cc9900"><h1>Controversy and Criticism</h1></FONT></a>
	<font face="calibri"><font color="#F2F2F2"><p>Like all previous Grand Theft Auto games, Grand Theft Auto V has courted controversy, though has been viewed by
	some as significantly more controversial than its predecessors.</P></font>
	<br>
	
	<a id="missions"><font color="#cc9900"><h2>Controversy (missions)</h2></font></a>
	<font face="calibri"><font color="#F2F2F2"><p>A mission which requires the player to torture a target for the government has proven significantly controversial. 
	The mission contains water-boarding, using a wrench on kneecaps and genitals, electrocution and even an action where 
	the player can perform tooth extraction using pliers.</p></font>
	<br>
	
	<a id="criticism"><font color="#cc9900"><h2>Criticism</h2></font></a>
	<font face="calibri"><font color="#F2F2F2"><p>Grand Theft Auto V received criticism both for the game and its Online counterpart. One part was missions, as only 
	three made the player profit, and only one of them topped $1,000,000. Missions were longer, more taxing and low to 
	non-paying. Only seven non-heist missions gave a payout; Franklin and Lamar gave the player $250, Nervous Ron gave the
	player $62,000 and Lester's Assassinations gave the player varying amounts of between $3,000 and $10,000. Further 
	criticism included the recent lack of an actual discounted price of the game during the Steam Summer Sale events for the
	PC version of GTA V, which retained the price at $60, resulting in a major backlash among other customers. The PC 
	version of GTA V was also criticized for the lack of an adequate anti-cheat with hackers becoming prevalent in Grand 
	Theft Auto Online and being dealt with very little, in addition to Rockstar Games' lack of efficiency in dealing with an 
	ongoing hacker problem and banning legitimate, non-cheating players instead.</P></font>

	<a id="copyright"><font color="#cc9900"><h2>Copyrighting and Lawsuits</h2></font></a>
	<font face="calibri"><font color="#F2F2F2"><p>After the game was released, actress Lindsay Lohan claimed that Rockstar had used her likeness without permission 
	for in-game celebrity Lacey Jonas, which Rockstar denied.[5] On 1 September 2016, Lohan's lawsuit was dismissed.</p>
	<p>In October 2013 Daz Dillinger claimed Rockstar used two songs from Death Row Records without permission, the songs 
	in question being "C-Walk" by Kurupt and "Nothin' But the Cavi Hit" by Tha Dogg Pound and Mack 10. However, Dillinger 
	was not signed to Death Row at the time and had an ongoing feud with Kurupt. The lawsuit was eventually dropped and 
	the songs stayed in the game.</p></font>

	<!-- TRIVIA SECTION -->
	<a id="trivia"><font color="#cc9900"><h1>Trivia</h1></font></a>
	<font face="calibri"><font color="#F2F2F2"><ul>
		<li>For the first time, convertible cars can retract and deploy their soft top/hard top covers. In previous games,
		convertibles<br> were stuck with the roof they had or didn't have (with the exception of being able to install a
		permanent cover on lowriders<br> in Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas).<br/><br></li>
		<li>Grand Theft Auto V is the first game in the franchise to feature in-game incidental music (not counting 
		cutscenes, credits<br> and pause menus, as several earlier games had incidental music for these aforementioned 
		sequences).</li><br><br>
		<li>The registration plates have orange stickers on the top right. The same plates are used for 
		2013 California registration<br> plates. The same was also used in California in 2008.</li><br><br>
		<li>If a player finds another one of the protagonists, or more likely tries to set them up in the same location,
		and begins<br> to follow them, the AI controlled protagonists will ask if the player is following them. Should they
		continue for too long,<br> the AI protagonist will consider they're being stalked and will knock out the player, 
		wasting them.</li><br><br>
		<li>Each protagonists' character was made to fit a specific Grand Theft Auto player:</li><br>
		
			<ul>
			<li>Michael initially represents the player who has already "beat the game", now living out their 
			life as a successfully<br> retired, wealthy criminal.</li><br>
			<li>Trevor is a complete psychopath, representing the type of player who prefers to kill people and 
			cause chaos<br> when they free roam.</li><br>
			<li>Franklin is a small time thug wanting to rise through the ranks of the criminal underworld similar 
			to the traditional<br> protagonists that the player controls in previous games.</li><br><br>		
			</ul>
	
		<li>Each protagonist seems to represent a different Rockstar game. Michael represents both Max Payne and 
		Red Dead <br>Redemption, seeing as he is a troubled retired, middle-aged "family man" with a criminal background 
		and bullet-time ability.<br> Franklin represents Midnight Club: Los Angeles, due to him being an ambitious young
		man with impressive driving skills.<br> Trevor represents Manhunt, mainly because of his psychotic personality 
		and reckless behaviour that defines his character.</li><br>
			<ul>
			<li>In addition, the protagonists' personalities can be determined by how long they sleep. Michael sleeps
			for 6 hours,<br> Franklin sleeps for 8 hours, and Trevor sleeps for 12 hours. This could mean that Franklin
			is the most "normal"<br> of the characters judging by his sleeping pattern.</li><br><br>
			</ul>
		<li>The game Saints Row IV has a DLC pack of weapons and clothes named GAT V, which is a reference to the 
		initials of <br>Grand Theft Auto V. The publisher, Deep Silver released it for free on PC, mocking GTA V's absence
		from the platform<br> at the time.</li><br><br>
		<li>The script for GTA V is 10,000+ pages long, according to Dan Houser in an interview in 2012. </li><br><br>
		<li>The name of the theme song ("Welcome To Los Santos") might be a reference to the first lyrics in 
		Young Maylay's <br>"San Andreas Theme Song" being "Welcome to San Andreas". </li><br>
			<ul>
			<li>Also, if the player listens to the two theme songs simultaneously, the buildup and beats of both
			songs are <br>very similar. The main difference is the use of instruments as the "San Andreas Theme Song" 
			has a much <br>more gangsta rap feel to it with a heavy reliance on acoustics (electronic piano, chimes)
			like early-1990s West <br>Coast hip-hop, while "Welcome to Los Santos" is infused with more bass and 
			horns in addition to acoustics to<br> give it a much "grander and open" feel (saxophone, trumpet).</li><br><br>
			</ul>
		<li>In the game, there is an animation for if the player gets stuck under a vehicle, 
		but it is almost never used.</li><br>
			<ul>
			<li>The animation is used if the player is stuck under a truck, but if the player is stuck under a car,<br>
			they will simply teleport next to the car.</li><br><br>
			</ul>
		<li>GTA V has similar mission structures to Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas such as heists requiring setup, as did<br>
		the main heist in GTA: San Andreas and introducing characters by name. Also, many flying missions resembled <br>
		ones from GTA: San Andreas such as Nervous Ron which required dropping equipment from a plane later on in<br>
		the mission like N.O.E. in GTA: San Andreas. Minor Turbulence also had similarities to N.O.E. but also Freefall<br>
		and Stowaway.</li><br><br>
		<li>There is a noticeable similarity between the GTA V logo and the icon on the 1899 $5 bill.</li><br><br>
		<li>GTA V is the third game in the series to start with a bank robbery, with Grand Theft Auto III and The Ballad<br>
		of Gay Tony being the first and second respectively. Unlike the previous two games, however, the bank robbery<br>
		in GTA V is a playable mission instead of just a mere cutscene. </li><br><br>
		<li>GTA V is the first game in the series since Grand Theft Auto Advance where the player can store all the weapons<br>
		in their inventory instead of replacing them. </li><br><br>
